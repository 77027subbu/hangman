I am happy that I spent the time in learning this framework. I think it makes web development easy, fast and fun to work with. If you haven't tried it before, or have not tried their latest version 5 lately, I would highly recommend you to give it a try.\r\n\r\nAs a part of learning curve, I wanted to test my skills in using a Apache Tapestry 5 and so I started writing up a program to simulate the Hangman game. The beauty I liked in Tapestry is that I can write my code as if I'm writing sequences for a stage or a game or to be more precise like state diagrams. \r\n\r\nI would like to divide the flow into 3 states or stages - \r\n\r\n* Initial Game Setup\r\n* User Guess\r\n* Win or Loss\r\n\r\nPlease be patient WIP...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@77027subbu is a campaigned programmer in developing solutions for the enterprise web and e-commerce platforms using Java and J2EE with interests in dynamic languages like Groovy, Ruby, Scala and the list goes on.
